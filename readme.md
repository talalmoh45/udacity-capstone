# Intro

The Casting Agency API supports a basic castic agency by allowing users to query the database for movies and actors. There are three different user roles (and related permissions), which are:
- Casting agent: Can view actors and movies.
- Casting director: Can view, add, modify, or delete actors; can view and modify movies.
- Executive producer: Can view, add, modify, or delete actors and movies. 

# Running the API [TODO]

API endpoints can be accessed via https://capstone-fsnd-varlese.herokuapp.com/

Auth0 information for endpoints that require authentication can be found in `setup.sh`.

# Running tests

To run the unittests, first CD into the Capstone folder and run the following command:
```
python -m agency.tests
```
